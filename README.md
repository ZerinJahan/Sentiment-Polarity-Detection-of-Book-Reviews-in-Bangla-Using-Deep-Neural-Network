# Sentiment Polarity Detection of Book Reviews in Bangla Using Deep Neural Networks
The project titled "Sentiment Polarity Detection of Book Reviews in Bangla Using Deep Neural Networks" focuses on analysing and classifying the sentiment polarity of Bangla book reviews. It involves extensive text analysis and sentiment analysis techniques to assess the emotional tone of the reviews. The project utilises embedding methods along with Bi-directional LSTM and GRU models to enhance the accuracy of sentiment classification. Implemented in Google Colab using Python, the project leverages libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and model training. Matplotlib is employed for visualising the results, providing insights into the sentiment trends within the book reviews.
